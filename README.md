Curvetopia: Transforming 2D Curves into Visual Masterpieces
Welcome to Curvetopia, a project dedicated to enhancing and perfecting 2D curves. Our mission is to take complex, imperfect polylines and transform them into refined, beautiful cubic B√©zier curves, contributing to the realms of computer graphics, computer vision, and digital art.

Project Goals
Curvetopia aims to provide a thorough solution for identifying, refining, and beautifying 2D curves. The key goals are:

Curve Identification: Detect and categorize geometric shapes (such as lines, circles, and ellipses) from given polylines.
Curve Regularization: Smooth and adjust these shapes to eliminate noise and irregularities.
Curve Beautification: Optimize curves for aesthetic quality, enhancing symmetry and completeness.
Theoretical Foundations
2D Euclidean Space
2D Euclidean Space
In 2D Euclidean space R^2, points are represented by coordinates
(x,y) on a flat plane. Curves in this space are continuous sets of points, which we aim to approximate with cubic B√©zier curves.
Cubic B√©zier Curves
Cubic B√©zier curves are popular in graphics for their flexibility and smoothness. They are defined by four control points: P0, P1, P2 and P3‚Äã
. The curve equation is:
B(t) = (1-t)^3 _ P0 + 3 _ (1-t)^2 _ t _ P1 + 3 _ (1-t) _ t^2 _ P2 + t^3 _ P3

where ùë°
t ranges from 0 to 1. These curves are ideal for representing complex shapes due to their smooth and adaptable nature.

Curve Regularization
Regularization refines curves to ensure smoothness and conformity to geometric shapes. This includes:

Straight Lines: Identifying and fitting linear segments.
Circles and Ellipses: Detecting and precisely fitting circular or elliptical curves.
Aesthetic Symmetry
Symmetry plays a crucial role in visual appeal. Our project focuses on detecting and enhancing symmetrical properties in curves to ensure they are not only accurate but also visually pleasing.

Curve Completion
Curve completion involves reconstructing incomplete or partially obscured curves. We use interpolation and geometric modeling techniques to restore these curves to their intended form.

Problem Statement
Curvetopia‚Äôs ultimate aim is to convert raster images (like PNGs) of line art into sets of cubic B√©zier curves. For the initial phase, we focus on polylines as input data.

Input
A set of polylines, each represented as a sequence of points in R^2
.
Output
A collection of cubic B√©zier curves, with regularization, symmetry, and completion applied.
Visualization
The resulting curves are visualized using SVG format, compatible with modern web browsers.
Key Components

1. Curve Regularization
   Refines curves to align with standard geometric forms:

Straight Lines: Detect and fit linear segments.
Circles and Ellipses: Precisely identify and fit circular or elliptical shapes. 2. Curve Completion
Reconstructs incomplete curves using interpolation and geometric modeling techniques.

3. Symmetry Detection
   Ensures curves are aesthetically balanced by detecting and enforcing symmetry.

This approach streamlines your code by using environment variables and utility functions, making it easier to maintain and update configurations.
